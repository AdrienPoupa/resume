    Light and slick material design music player for Android
  description: |
    This is a local music player for <mark>Android</mark>, written in <mark>Java</mark>. Forked from Phonograph, it is easy to use and customizable
    (multiple themes including a dark one). It supports folder browsing, sleep timer and a tag editor.

    It currently has over 10,000 installs on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.poupa.vinylmusicplayer)
    and over 200 stars on [GitHub](https://github.com/AdrienPoupa/VinylMusicPlayer).
    Because I care about open-source, it is also available on the [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.poupa.vinylmusicplayer) application store.

    Doodle alternative built using Laravel
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    This is a <mark>Laravel</mark> application that provides an alternative to the well-known proprietary service [Doodle](https://doodle.com).

    It is a rewrite of [Framadate](https://framadate.org/). I plan to refactor the frontend to use <mark>Vue.js</mark> or <mark>React</mark>.
