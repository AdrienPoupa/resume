    It is a 2-year [program](https://www.concordia.ca/ginacody/computer-science-software-eng/programs/software-eng/meng.html) dedicated to Software Engineering.
    aimed at enhancing analytic and design skills as well as improve one's ability to present technical material in written form.
    Throughout the program, I was trained to work on all aspects of the software product life cycle and learned
    how to develop high-capacity computer software in a controlled, systematic and quantifiable manner and
    ensure it is reliable, efficient and economic.

    Here is the list of the courses I have taken:
    - Advanced Programming Practices:
    I wrote a [tweet displayer](https://github.com/AdrienPoupa/soen6441) using the <mark>Play framework</mark> in <mark>Java</mark>.
    I [replicated](https://github.com/AdrienPoupa/soen7481-project) the paper
    ["How Not to Structure Your Database-backed Web Applications: A Study of Performance Bugs in the Wild"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453153)
    in the Laravel ecosystem. I found performance issues in some open-source applications and I fixed them.
    - Intro to Artificial Intelligence: I wrote [3 mini projects](https://github.com/AdrienPoupa/comp6721) in <mark>Java</mark> and <mark>Python</mark>
    to learn about Good Old Fashioned Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning on datasets and Natural Language Processing.
    - Software Verification and Testing:
    I wrote a [static bug detector](https://github.com/AdrienPoupa/soen7481-assignment) in <mark>Java</mark>.
    - Advanced Design Software Architecture
    - Software Comprehension and Maintenance
    - Software Design Methodologies
    - Software Engineering Processes
    - Software Measurement
    - Software Project Management
    - Systems Requirements Specifications

  qualification: Bachelor and Masters of Software Engineering

    I started to study computer science and software engineering full-time at Efrei
    (Engineering School of Information and Digital Technologies),
    where I prepared an engineering bachelor and masters degree in software engineering.

    I obtained my undergraduate degree in software engineering there, and took advantage of the dual-degree program
    they had with Concordia University to move to Montreal. This means that graduating in Montreal made me also
    graduate from Efrei with a Masters.

    Exchange semester done while I was studying at Efrei. This is when I discovered what living abroad was like for the
    first time and that played a major role in my decision to move to Canada.

    I took the following courses there:
    - Entrepreneurship
    - Operating Systems
    - Introduction to Web Programming
    - Object Oriented Methods with UML

    Two-year undergraduate intensive course in mathematics, physics, engineering sciences and computer science.

    Icam (Institut Catholique des Arts et Metiers) is a general engineering school, with a focus in mechanic.

    At the term of this two-year formation, I passed a national exam (Banque PT) and entered Efrei,
    which was my top choice as I wanted to prepare a software engineering degree rather than a mechanical one.
