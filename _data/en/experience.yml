    Worked on <mark>PHP</mark> applications based on <mark>Laravel</mark> and <mark>Vue.js</mark>, also sometimes on
    <mark>WordPress</mark>, <mark>Zend Framework</mark>, <mark>jQuery</mark> and other related technologies and languages.

    I am also very interested in the <mark>DevOps</mark> side of those applications as I created an complete architecture on
    <mark>AWS</mark> to host them. The details are present on my blog.

    I mostly worked on two projects:

    - A financial application built on <mark>Laravel</mark> and <mark>Vue.js</mark> used by financial advisors.
    I wrote the export engine that is responsible for generating PDF files that are handed out to the client.
    I also wrote a generic integration engine that allows fetching financial data from various external providers.
    I am the principal maintainer of the application so I am responsible for bug fixing and developing new features as well.
    - A multi tenant legacy <mark>PHP</mark> application for which I created the <mark>AWS</mark> infrastructure mentioned above.
    There were discrepancies between the tenants' databases that I fixed.
    I created a new <mark>Laravel</mark> application that runs next to the legacy application that is used to
    create new features using a modern technology stack, using the strangler pattern.

    I prepared the repository for a migration from <mark>SVN</mark> to <mark>Git</mark> by removing unnecessary files

    I developed a few projects, including [BlockPharma](https://www.blockpharma.com), a <mark>Laravel</mark> application
    that uses the blockchain to fight against drug counterfeiting by associating the datamatrix present on each
    drug's package to a unique blockchain transaction by using additional data.
    That way, the drug's history cannot be altered.

    Diagamter sells its brand and IT platform, called monDiagamter, to franchisers.
    This platform is based on <mark>Laravel</mark>, and I gained my first professional experience developing
