  I am a full-stack developer based in Montreal, QC, Canada.

  As far as I remember, I have always been interested by computers and programming in general.
  I started playing around with programming at 13, mainly hacking PHP scripts.

  I am currently working for [Turbulent](https://turbulent.ca)
  on [Star Citizen](https://robertsspaceindustries.com)'s e-commerce website.

  I am also interested in <mark>DevOps</mark>, the <mark>AWS</mark> platform, and the cloud in general.

  Open-source software is really important for me, so I try to give back to the community as much as I can
  by creating new packages, sharing the knowledge I have on my blog, submitting pull requests or reporting bugs.

  I enjoy working with a variety of languages and frameworks and I am always eager to try something new.

  Born and raised in Toulouse, France, I moved to Montreal in 2017 to pursue a Masters degree in Software Engineering
  at Concordia University. Before that, I was studying Software Engineering at Efrei near Paris.
