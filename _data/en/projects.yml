    Light and slick material design music player for Android
  description: |
    This is a local music player for <mark>Android</mark>, written in <mark>Java</mark>. Forked from Phonograph, it is easy to use and customizable
    (multiple themes including a dark one). It supports folder browsing, sleep timer and a tag editor.

    It currently has over 10,000 installs on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.poupa.vinylmusicplayer)
    and over 400 stars on [GitHub](https://github.com/AdrienPoupa/VinylMusicPlayer).
    Because I care about open-source, it is also available on the [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.poupa.vinylmusicplayer) application store.

    Travel certificate Android application during France's COVID lockdown.
  description: |
    At the peak of the epidemic wave, the French government mandated the usage of travel certificates to curb the number
    of cases. Those certificates were required to run errands including going to the grocery store.
    The application provided an official form as well as a website to fill it, but no native mobile application.

    I created a clean, simple and permissionless application to fill the form from a native application.
    It was very sucessful as it reached 1 million of active devices in December 2020 on the Play Store alone.

    I am glad to have been able to help many people through a difficult time.

    Doodle alternative built using Laravel
  description: |
    This is a <mark>Laravel</mark> application that provides an alternative to the well-known proprietary service [Doodle](https://doodle.com).

    It is a rewrite of [Framadate](https://framadate.org/). I plan to refactor the frontend to use <mark>Vue.js</mark> or <mark>React</mark>.
