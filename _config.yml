  When I'm not behind a computer, you can usually find me devoting myself to one of my hobbies.

  In the summer, it is leg day everyday as I bike everywhere. I find biking to work very rewarding. Some day, I will also bike during the winter!

  In the winter, as I still need to exercise, I play badminton.

  I like to discover Quebec's nature when I go on hikes, especially during Fall when temperatures drop and the foliage turn from green to auburn and gold.

  Cooking is my way relax, it is usually a good recipe to clear my mind.
